# euler_calc
Code to estimate a pole of rotation from GNSS / GPS data

by Eric Lindsey, last updated 2022

euler_calc.py contains a set of routines to predict plate motion velocities given an Euler pole (pole of rotation on a spherical planet). 
Routines are also provided to estimate the best-fitting euler poles from input velocity observations (e.g. GNSS velocities), and to 
identify sites moving together as one block. 

For usage and an example workflow, see the ipython notebook included.
